= Jersey Debug AutoBundle

Additional support for one line switch for debugging Jersey managed resources.
It will be useful when your resources misbehave, or you cannot assemble valid request.

By default, Jersey tracing is set to verbose level with on demand.
This means that your requests have to append additional headers:

- `X-Jersey-Tracing-Accept: true`
- `X-Jersey-Tracing-Threshold: VERBOSE`
